; This file is used to tell Akeeba Strapper which files it should NOT load at
; all. The file located in your site's media/akeeba_strapper works globally,
; both in the front- and back-end. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO USE IT AS IT
; WILL BREAK THE BACK-END OF YOUR EXTENSIONS!
;
; Instead, we urge you to copy this inside your site template's directory. For
; example, if you have a template named foobar, copy this file to:
;
; /templates/foobar/media/akeeba_strapper/strapper.ini
;
; and modify the options below, depending on what you want to achieve.
